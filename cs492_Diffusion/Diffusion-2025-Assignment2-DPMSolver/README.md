## Abstract
DPM-Solver is a novel ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver specifically designed to solve PF-ODEs in just a few steps by exploiting their special structure. The key insight is that the PF-ODE of diffusion models can be decomposed into a linear part and a nonlinear part, a property known as the semi-linear structure. With this decomposition, one can compute the exact solution of the linear part while approximating only the nonlinear part using a Taylor expansion. Increasing the order of the Taylor expansion leads to more accurate solutions. Notably, the authors show that the first-order DPM-Solver is mathematically equivalent to DDIM.

In this assignment, we explore a high-order solver of the ODEs for diffusion models. The more accurate the solver is, the faster the sampling can be done with fewer steps. Let's say the forward pass of diffusion models is represented as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
q(x_t | x_0) = \mathcal{N}(x_t | \alpha(t) x_0, \sigma^2(t) I).
\end{align*}
$$

The forward pass can be expressed its corresponding SDE form:

$$
dx_t = f(t) x_t dt + g(t) dw_t, \\
\text{where } f(t) = \frac{d \log \alpha_t}{dt} \text{ and } g^2(t) = \frac{d\sigma_t^2}{dt} - 2 \frac{d \log \alpha_t}{dt}\sigma_t^2.
$$

According to [Song et al. [ICLR'21]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13456), we can also compute the ODE form of the _reverse_ process:

$$
\begin{align*}
dx_t = [f(t) x_t + \frac{g^2(t)}{2 \sigma_t} \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t) ] dt,
\end{align*}
$$

which is called Probability Flow ODE (PF-ODE). Note that this ODE equation is a first-order linear non-homogeneous equation, for which exact solution can be computed:

$$
\begin{align*}
x_t = e^{\int_s^t f(\tau) d\tau} x_s + \int_s^t ( e^{\int_\tau^t f(r) dr} \frac{g^2(\tau)}{2 \sigma_\tau} \epsilon_\theta(x_\tau, \tau) ) d\tau,
\end{align*}
$$

where the first term on the right side is a linear term, and the second term, which involves an integral over noise predictions, is a non-linear term.

To simplify the ODE solution equaiton, we introduce a new notation, $\lambda_t := \log (\alpha_t / \sigma_t)$, and use "change-of-variable" for $\lambda$. Then, we have:

$$
\begin{align*}
x_t = \frac{\alpha_t}{\alpha_s} x_s - \alpha_t \int\_{\lambda_s}^{\lambda_t} e^{-\lambda} \hat{\epsilon}\_\theta (\hat{x}_\lambda, \lambda) d\lambda,
\end{align*}
$$

where $\hat{x}\_\lambda := x\_{t(\lambda)}$ and $\hat{\epsilon}\_\theta (\hat{x}_\lambda, \lambda):= \epsilon\_\theta (x\_{t(\lambda)}, t(\lambda))$.


Now the simplified solution reveals the integral is represented as the _exponentially weighted integral_ of $\hat{\epsilon}_\theta$, which is closely related to the _exponential integrators_ commonly discussed in the literature of ODE solvers.

We can apply a Taylor expansion into the solution:

$$
\begin{align*}
\hat{\epsilon}\_\theta (\hat{x}\_\lambda, \lambda) = \sum_{n=0}^{k-1} \frac{(\lambda - \lambda\_{s})^n}{n!} \hat{\epsilon}_\theta^{(n)} (\hat{x}\_{\lambda\_s}, \lambda_s) + \mathcal{O}((\lambda - \lambda_s)^k),
\end{align*}
$$

where $\hat{\epsilon}\_\theta^{(n)}$ is the $n$-th order derivative of $\hat{\epsilon}_\theta$.


As a result, we can obtain an approximation for $x_s \rightarrow x_t$ with the $k$-order approximation. For instance, as $k=1$, which is called DPM-Solver-1, the solution is:

$$
\begin{align*}
x_t = \frac{\alpha_t}{\alpha_s} x_s - \sigma_t (e^{h}-1) \epsilon_\theta (x_s, s), \text{ where } h = \lambda_t - \lambda_s.
\end{align*}
$$

For $k \leq 2$, Taylor expansion needs additional intermediate points between $t$ and $s$. Below is an algorithm when $k=2$, called DPM-Solver-2.
